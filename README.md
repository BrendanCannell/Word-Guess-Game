# Word-Guess-Game

The theme of the puzzle words is functional programming. Presentation-wise, I imitated an old terminal and used Unicode box drawing characters to create the graphic.

The program is structured based on what I've read about Redux, with all state data contained in a single immutable object generated by reducing an event stream, and with subscribers that listen for state changes and potentially dispatch new events. I used the React approach of simply re-rendering the page after each update. It's just a block of text anyway, except for one element wrapping the cursor to make it blink. And I used the persistent data structure library Immutable.js.
